Upon framing of the wall, OSB or plywood is applied onsite utilizing the practice of staggering the panel seams with the sheathing, tying everything together to obtain the strongest, airtight wall or roof possible.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <strong>How do I install plumbing and wiring through the panel?</strong> <br/> <ul> <li>Simply use a router or Sawzall set to a depth of 1/2 the thickness of the panel to cut out a channel where the wire/plumbing will run. Drill holes through integrated studs where necessary. Install wiring/plumbing in the slit and after inspection, backfill with canned foam.

They will be cut-to-fit onsite. RAY-CORE panels are non-directional; thus when a cut for an opening is made, you may flip the panel around and use it on an adjacent wall or portion of roof.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <strong>How do I frame corners using RAY-CORE?</strong> <br/> <ul> <li>There are several ways you can frame corners using RAY-CORE SIPs. You can install a double stud on one wall and put the next panel (stud side) <strong>against it</strong><strong>against it</strong>. Many framers choose to start with a "California Corner" and fill the void with scrap foam. You can also cut into the panel and insert a stud for a drywall nail surface.See corner detail:</li> </ul> </li> <li> <strong>How do I install sheetrock when interior wall meets the exterior RAY-CORE wall (T's)?</strong> <br/> <ul> <li>Remember to think standard framing when working with RAY-CORE Structural Insulated Panels. Simply install the exterior wall sheetrock 1st and then apply the interior wall sheetrock 2nd, so the interior sheetrock pinches the other against the wall. Although by no means is it necessary, some installers may choose to apply construction adhesive or utilize drywall clips.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <strong>How do I cut the panels?</strong> <br/> <ul> <li>There is no need for hot knives or special tools. The most efficient means of cutting RAY-CORE SIP panels is to use a large beam saw. If you don't currently own one, these saws are generally available and your local equipment rental location at a small daily charge. The panels can be cut with a smaller saw by cutting from both sides of the RAY-CORE wall panel or roof panel.</li> <li> <strong>Level</strong> <ul> <li>This is a test</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> <script type="text/javascript" src="../accordion.js"></script></body> </html>
